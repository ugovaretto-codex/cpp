C++17 supports, in addition to previously supported features such as vadiadic
templates, folding expressions which allow code to avoid the standard
recursion mechanism employed to traverse a variadic template declaration by
simply specifying the operation to be performend in addition to an ellipsis
symbol (`...`).
